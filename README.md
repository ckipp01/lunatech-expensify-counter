# lunatech-expensify-counter
google chrome extension to show the amount left from annual personal budget

As Expensify Api is self-serve, the way of getting credentials is not perfect now:
user is directed onto page where they are generated. Then those credentials are parsed out of the page.

After, API calls to get needed reports & calculate amount will be done. Currently is not implemented yet.
